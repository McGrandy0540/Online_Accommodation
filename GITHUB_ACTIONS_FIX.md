# GitHub Actions Submodule Error Fix

## Problem Description

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the following error:
```
Error: fatal: No url found for submodule path 'vendor/phpmailer/phpmailer' in .gitmodules
Error: The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128
```

## Root Cause

The issue occurred because:
1. The `vendor/` directory (containing Composer dependencies) was being tracked in Git
2. PHPMailer was incorrectly treated as a Git submodule instead of a Composer dependency
3. No `.gitignore` file existed to properly exclude vendor files
4. GitHub Actions was trying to initialize submodules that didn't have proper configuration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `.gitignore` file
- Added `vendor/` to ignore Composer dependencies
- Added other common PHP project exclusions (logs, cache, uploads, etc.)

### 2. Removed vendor directory from Git tracking
- Executed `git rm -r --cached vendor/` to untrack the vendor directory
- This resolved the submodule conflict

### 3. Created proper GitHub Actions workflow
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with proper PHP setup
- Configured Composer to install dependencies during CI/CD
- Added caching for better performance
- Included PHP syntax checking and basic testing framework

### 4. Verified local setup
- Ran `composer install` to regenerate vendor directory locally
- Confirmed PHPMailer is properly installed via Composer

## Files Modified/Created

1. **`.gitignore`** - New file to exclude vendor and other unnecessary files
2. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - New GitHub Actions workflow
3. **Removed from Git tracking**: All files in `vendor/` directory

## How the Fix Works

1. **Local Development**: 
   - Developers run `composer install` to get dependencies
   - `vendor/` directory is ignored by Git

2. **GitHub Actions**:
   - Checks out code (without vendor directory)
   - Sets up PHP environment
   - Runs `composer install` to download dependencies
   - PHPMailer is properly installed as a Composer package
   - No submodule conflicts occur

## Future Maintenance

### Adding New Dependencies
```bash
composer require package/name
git add composer.json composer.lock
git commit -m "Add new dependency: package/name"
```

### Updating Dependencies
```bash
composer update
git add composer.lock
git commit -m "Update Composer dependencies"
```

### Important Notes
- **Never commit the `vendor/` directory** - it should always be ignored
- **Always commit `composer.lock`** - it ensures consistent dependency versions
- **Run `composer install` after cloning** - to set up dependencies locally

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Check the Actions tab in your repository
3. The workflow should now complete successfully without submodule errors

## Workflow Features

The new GitHub Actions workflow includes:
- **Multi-PHP version testing** (8.0, 8.1, 8.2)
- **Composer dependency caching** for faster builds
- **PHP syntax validation** for all project files
- **Automatic deployment** on main branch pushes (customizable)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Locally**: Ensure `composer install` runs without errors
2. **GitHub Actions**: Check that `composer.json` and `composer.lock` are committed
3. **Dependencies**: Verify all required PHP extensions are listed in the workflow
