This is a placeholder for the deployment package. In a real implementation, I would create a zip file containing:
1. All project files with database config set to 'localhost'
2. A README with upload instructions
3. .htaccess file for proper routing

Since I can't create actual zip files, I'll provide the instructions instead:

STEP 1: Update database configuration in config/database.php to:
    private $host = 'localhost';

STEP 2: Compress all project files into a ZIP archive

STEP 3: Upload to InfinityFree:
1. Log in to control panel
2. Go to "File Manager"
3. Upload ZIP file
4. Extract files in public_html directory

STEP 4: Access your application at your InfinityFree domain
